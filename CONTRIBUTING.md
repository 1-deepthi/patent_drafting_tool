## Code of Conduct

By participating you agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, assume good faith, and keep discussions focused on the work.

---

## Ways to contribute

- **Report bugs** — use the Bug report issue template, include repro steps, expected vs actual, logs, and environment.
- **Propose features** — use the Feature request template, describe the problem first, then the proposal and alternatives.
- **Improve docs** — typos, clarifications, missing steps, and new guides are all welcome (use the Documentation template).
- **Fix code** — pick an issue labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`, or open an issue first for larger changes.
- **Review PRs** — thoughtful reviews are contributions too.

> This phase of the project is **docs + CI focused** (per maintainers). Code changes should be small, surgical, and covered by the PR template. Large refactors (e.g. removing the legacy SQL stack) need an approved issue first.

## Project overview

- `backend/` — FastAPI + Firebase Admin (active: `app/api/auth.py`, `app/api/resources.py`, `app/core/firebase.py`, `app/core/security.py`, `app/services/repository.py`). Legacy Postgres/SQLAlchemy code remains in-tree for reference but is not mounted.
- `frontend/` — React 18 + Vite 6 + TypeScript (`strict`) + Tailwind 3. Role-guarded routes in `src/App.tsx`.
- `docker-compose.yml` — local Postgres + backend for full-stack testing.
- `.github/workflows/` — `ci.yml` (lint/test/build matrix), `docker.yml` (image builds), `codeql.yml` (security scan).

Detailed design: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [`docs/API_OVERVIEW.md`](./docs/API_OVERVIEW.md), [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.11+ (3.13 recommended) | `python --version` |
| Node | 20.x | `node --version` |
| npm | 10+ | `npm --version` |
| Git | 2.40+ | `git --version` |
| Docker + Compose | 24+ / v2 (optional) | `docker --version` |
| Firebase project | Firestore + Auth enabled | See `backend/README.md` §2 |

Windows contributors: use **Windows PowerShell 5.1+** (commands below assume it). macOS/Linux contributors: translate `Copy-Item` → `cp` and venv activation accordingly.

---

## Getting the code

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/auraflaa/patent_drafting_tool.git
cd patent_drafting_tool
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
```

Branch types: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `ci/`, `refactor/`, `test/`. Example: `docs/add-architecture-guide`.

Keep your branch up to date:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

---

## Commit discipline (atomic commits)

Every commit must do **one logical thing** and stay reviewable. This is enforced in review — PRs with giant mixed commits are sent back for splitting.

- **Size targets:** ~100 lines per commit is ideal, ~300 acceptable for a single logical change (e.g. one complete guide), ~1000+ must be split. A commit that touches docs *and* workflows *and* repo config is three commits, not one.
- **Separate concerns:** docs, CI, community-health files, and repo hygiene each get their own commit(s). Never mix formatting-only changes with behavior changes, and never bundle a refactor with a feature.
- **One commit = one type:** the commit-type prefix (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `ci`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`) must describe the *whole* commit. If you need two prefixes, you need two commits.
- **Example stack** (how the open-source foundation of this repo was landed — each line is one commit):
  ```text
  docs: rewrite README with full product and setup guide
  docs: add getting-started, architecture, API, development, and Docker guides
  docs: add contributor documentation set (contributing, conduct, security, accessibility, support, changelog)
  docs: add Apache-2.0 license
  docs: add GitHub community-health files (PR template, issue forms, owners, dependabot)
  ci: add cross-OS lint/test/build matrix workflow
  ci: add Docker build+smoke and CodeQL workflows
  chore: standardise repo hygiene (gitignore, editorconfig, gitattributes, version pins)
  ```
- **Verify per commit:** each commit in the stack must leave the tree in a working state — run the relevant check (`python -m compileall app`, `npm run build`, YAML parse) before moving to the next slice, not just once at the end.
- **Messages explain why:** subject in imperative mood (<72 chars), blank line, body with intent and scope notes. `docs: expand getting-started Firebase steps` + why, not `update file`.

---

## Backend setup

```powershell
cd backend
py -3.13 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env: FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Verify:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs — interactive API docs
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/health — `200 ok` once Firebase is configured, `503 degraded` before that (expected)

Firebase setup (project creation, Firestore, Auth providers, service-account JSON → `backend/secrets/firebase-service-account.json`): [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) §2 and [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

> Never commit `.env` or `secrets/`. Both are git-ignored and CI never needs real credentials.

---

## Frontend setup

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server (`:5173`) |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -b && vite build` → `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build |
| `npm run lint` | `eslint .` |

---

## Running with Docker

```powershell
# Full local stack (postgres + backend):
docker compose up --build

# Backend image only:
docker build -t patent-backend ./backend
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file backend/.env patent-backend

# Frontend image only (VITE_API_URL is baked at build time):
docker build --build-arg VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 -t patent-frontend ./frontend
docker run -p 8080:80 patent-frontend
```

More: [`docs/DOCKER.md`](./docs/DOCKER.md).

---

## Branching and commits

- One logical change per PR. Keep diffs small and reviewable.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  - `feat: add patent submit confirmation dialog`
  - `fix: correct assignment accept guard for agents`
  - `docs: expand getting-started Firebase steps`
  - `ci: add windows runner to frontend build matrix`
  - `chore: bump vite to 6.x`
  - `test: cover questionnaire submit flow`
- Write imperative, specific subjects (<72 chars), blank line, then body explaining **why**.
- Never commit secrets, `.env` files, `secrets/*.json`, `dist/`, `__pycache__/`, or `venv/`.

---

## Making changes

1. **Find the right place.** Backend route → `backend/app/api/`; Firestore logic → `backend/app/services/repository.py`; auth guards → `backend/app/core/security.py`; frontend page → `frontend/src/pages/`; shared fetch → `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`; types → `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`.
2. **Match existing patterns.** Backend: `require_roles` / `is_admin` guards, `clean()` before returning user docs, `404` via `patch_doc`/`delete_doc` helpers. Frontend: `ProtectedRoute` guards, `apiFetch`/`apiUpload`, `StatusBadge` colors, `DashboardShell` layout.
3. **Do not expand scope.** Don't reformat unrelated files, don't "clean up" adjacent systems, don't delete legacy SQL code without an approved migration issue.
4. **Update docs** when behavior, env vars, or routes change (README + relevant `docs/` page + `CHANGELOG.md` Unreleased).

---

## Required checks before a PR

Run these locally — CI runs the same on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest`:

```powershell
# Backend (from backend/)
python -m compileall app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q

# Frontend (from frontend/)
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Notes:

- Backend `tests/` currently target the **legacy SQL API** and require Postgres + legacy mounts. If they fail for environment reasons (no Postgres, Firebase-only checkout), note it in the PR and include the `compileall` output. Do not "fix" by deleting tests — open an issue instead.
- Frontend `npm run build` includes `tsc -b`; a clean build means types pass.
- Docker-affecting PRs: also run the relevant `docker build` from [`docs/DOCKER.md`](./docs/DOCKER.md).

---

## Opening a pull request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.
2. Fill in **every section** of the PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`): summary, linked issues (`Fixes #123`), type, scope, testing evidence, screenshots for UI, checklist.
3. Keep the PR focused; link follow-ups instead of piling them in.
4. Respond to review comments; resolve threads when addressed; re-request review.
5. Maintainers squash-merge; your PR title becomes the squash message — keep it conventional-commit clean.

Draft PRs are welcome for early feedback — mark as draft and note what is unfinished.

---

## Code style

**Python (backend):**

- Follow PEP 8, 4-space indents, double quotes where the file already uses them.
- Type-hint new functions; keep Firestore helpers thin (see `services/repository.py`).
- No `print()` in committed code; use the app logger.
- Keep imports sorted stdlib → third-party → local.

**TypeScript/React (frontend):**

- `strict` mode, `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` — no unused vars.
- Functional components + hooks; named exports (no default exports except pages where already used).
- Validate forms with React Hook Form + Zod; fetch via `apiFetch`/`apiUpload`/`apiDownload` only.
- Use `cn()`-style conditional classes consistently; reuse `StatusBadge`, `DashboardShell`, `ProtectedRoute`.

**General:**

- Add or update tests/docs alongside behavior changes.
- Prefer the boring, obvious solution over clever abstractions.

---

## Testing guide

- Backend: `python -m pytest -q` (see `pytest.ini`: `asyncio_mode=auto`). Tests live in `backend/tests/` with `conftest.py` fixtures and `helpers.py` builders.
- Frontend: no unit-test runner is configured yet — verification is `tsc` + `vite build` + manual role-walkthroughs (Innovator / Agent / Admin / Super Admin). If you add a test runner, document it in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` in the same PR.
- Manual QA checklist for workflow PRs: create team → create patent → fill questionnaire → submit → assign agent → accept → generate draft → generate document → approve user → export report.

---

## Docs contributions

- Docs live in `README.md` + `docs/*.md` + `backend/README.md` + `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Keep headings sentence-case, code blocks labeled (`powershell`, `bash`, `text`), tables aligned, and links relative (`./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- If you add an env var, update `.env.example`, the README env table, and the relevant `docs/` page in the same PR.
- Check markdown rendering (VS Code preview or `npx markdownlint` if available) before pushing.

---

## Review process

- All PRs need at least one maintainer approval; `CODEOWNERS` auto-requests reviewers.
- CI (`ci.yml`, `docker.yml`, `codeql.yml`) must be green. Failures must be fixed or explicitly waived by a maintainer with a follow-up issue.
- Reviewers check: scope discipline, auth guards (`require_roles` / `ProtectedRoute`), no secrets, docs updated, tests evidence present.

---

## Release process

Maintainers only. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md):

1. Curate `Unreleased` into a version section (`YYYY-MM-DD`, Keep a Changelog format).
2. Tag `vX.Y.Z`, push tag, verify CI + Docker builds on the tag.
3. Attach release notes summarizing features, fixes, and migration notes.
