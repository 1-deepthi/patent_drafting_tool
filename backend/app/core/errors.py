"""Turn an unhandled exception into a normal API error response.

Starlette handles the `Exception` exception handler inside `ServerErrorMiddleware`,
which wraps *every* user middleware. A 500 produced there would carry neither
the CORS headers nor the security headers added further in, so the browser sees
an opaque CORS/network failure instead of the API's message.

This middleware sits inside CORS and converts the exception itself, keeping the
response shape the same as the one the old `@app.exception_handler(Exception)`
produced. The traceback still reaches the log, which is where it belongs.
