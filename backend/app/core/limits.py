"""Request-size enforcement shared by middleware and upload handlers.

Vercel rejects request bodies above 4.5 MB before the app sees them, so the
app has to stay below that on its own. `Settings.upload_limit_bytes` carries
the effective per-file limit; this module turns it into HTTP responses and
guards request bodies early.
