                                 (all app data)   (files, templates,
                                                   generated documents)
```

- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): React 18 SPA, React Router role-guarded routes, React Query, Hook Form + Zod. Firebase JS SDK performs Google sign-in; `VITE_*` values are baked at build time, so there is no runtime env.
- **Backend** (`backend/app/main.py`): FastAPI with a `lifespan` that attempts `initialize_firebase()` but never blocks boot. `/health` probes Firestore. Mounts exactly two routers: `auth` (`/api/auth`) and `resources` (`/api`). CORS + TrustedHost middleware; a generic 500 handler that stays terse in production.
- **Firebase**: Authentication is the identity provider; Firestore is the system of record; Storage holds blobs. The Admin SDK runs privileged, so Firestore Security Rules do **not** replace backend authorization.

## 2. Request lifecycle

1. The browser signs in through Firebase Auth (Google popup, redirect fallback) and holds a Firebase **ID token**.
2. `src/lib/api.ts` registers an async token provider (`setTokenProvider`), so every request asks Firebase for a current token before calling the API. There is no cached token to expire in the client.
3. `app/core/security.py:current_user` verifies the token (`verify_id_token`), loads `users/{uid}`, and creates the profile on first sight (bootstrap email → `SUPER_ADMIN` + approved; everyone else → `INNOVATOR` + pending).
4. `active_user` rejects non-approved or disabled accounts (`403`).
5. Endpoints then use `ensure_permission(user, "<CODE>")` and/or `require_roles(...)` / `is_admin()` / `is_super_admin()`.
6. `app/services/projections.py` decides visibility (`patent_visible`, `visible_patents`, `require_patent`) and serialises documents into the REST shapes the client expects.

## 3. Roles, permissions, and auth model

| Role code | Granted by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `INNOVATOR` | Default for new users | Own teams + patents |
| `PATENT_AGENT` | `SUPER_ADMIN` via `/api/rbac/users/{id}/roles` | Can be assigned patents |
| `ADMIN` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Approve users, assign agents, manage templates |
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | Bootstrap email, then `SUPER_ADMIN` only | Full control incl. role assignment |

- Roles are stored as `role_codes: string[]` on the user document (ADR-002). The API projects them as `roles`.
- Internal state is lowercase (`account_status`: `pending` → `approved` / `rejected`); the API projects Title-Case values (`Pending`, `Approved`, …) for the existing UI.
- The permission catalog is code-defined in `app/services/rbac.py`: 4 roles × 27 permissions, with sensible defaults per role. Super Admin always holds every permission. Super Admin toggles are stored in `rbac_overrides`; report-download grants live in `report_permission_overrides`. No seed script is required — an empty Firebase project falls back to the code-defined matrix.
- Admins can toggle the matrix (`/api/rbac/toggle`), but only Super Admin can assign or revoke roles.
- Sign-in is browser-side only: no server-minted JWT, no refresh endpoint, no dev login. The product's 30-minute inactivity rule is enforced by `AuthContext`, which signs the Firebase session out after idling.
- Route guards: `ProtectedRoute(requireRole=[...], requirePermission=...)` redirects to `/login`, `/pending-approval`, or `/not-authorized`.

## 4. Firestore collections

No joins, no migrations — documents are linked by string IDs and filtered in the service layer.

| Collection | Key fields | Linked by |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | `role_codes[]`, `account_status`, `approved_by/at`, `last_login_at` | `uid` (doc ID) |
| `teams` | `team_name`, `team_status`, `created_by` | `created_by` + `members` subcollection |
| `teams/{id}/members` | membership row per user | `user_id` (doc ID) |
| `patents` | `team_id`, `invention_title`, `application_status`, `assigned_patent_agent_id`, `assignment_history[]`, lifecycle sub-statuses | `created_by`, `team_id`, `assigned_patent_agent_id` |
| `applicants`, `inventors` | `patent_application_id`, order fields | `patent_application_id` |
| `questionnaires` | `patent_application_id`, status, answers | `patent_application_id` |
| `questionnaire_versions` | snapshot + `version_number` | `patent_application_id` |
| `drafts` | `patent_application_id`, `section_type`, `version_number`, `ai_response` | `patent_application_id` |
| `documents` | `patent_application_id`, `output_format`, `stored_path` | `patent_application_id` |
| `document_versions` | `document_id`, `version_number`, `storage_path` | `document_id` |
| `document_jobs` | `patent_application_id`, `status`, `error_message` | `patent_application_id` |
| `files` | `patent_application_id`, `stored_path`, `uploaded_by` | `patent_application_id` |
| `comments` | `patent_application_id`, `user_id`, `comment_text` | `patent_application_id` |
| `calendar_events` | `patent_application_id`, `event_type`, `event_date` | patent and/or creator |
| `notifications` | `recipient_uid`, `notification_type`, `is_read` | recipient |
| `templates` | `document_type`, `is_active`, `stored_path` | one active per type |
| `activity` | `user_id`, `event_type`, `entity_type/id` | dashboard feed |
| `rbac_overrides` | `granted` per `role_id:permission_id` | RBAC matrix |
| `report_permission_overrides` | `granted` per `role_id:report_type` | report matrix |

Probe collection `_health` is used only by `/health`.

## 5. Patent lifecycle

The API accepts and returns the full product vocabulary, using Title-Case statuses:

```text
Draft → Submitted → Awaiting Patent Agent Acceptance → Under Review
→ Changes Requested → Ready for Draft Generation → Draft Generated
→ Ready for Filing → Filed → Examination Requested → FER Received
→ FER Response Submitted → Hearing Scheduled → Granted / Rejected / Withdrawn / Abandoned
```

Transitions currently produced by the API:

```text
create (Draft) → submit (Submitted) → assign/auto-assign (Awaiting Patent Agent Acceptance)
  → accept (Under Review) → generate draft or document (Draft Generated)
  → reject (back to Submitted, assignment cleared) → reassign
```

Guards in `app/api/resources.py` and `app/services/projections.py`:

- `submit`: patent creator or admin, and only while `Draft`.
- `assign` / `auto-assign` / `reassign`: `ADMIN`/`SUPER_ADMIN`; assignee must be an approved `PATENT_AGENT`; auto-assign picks the lowest active assignment count. Assignment history is appended to the patent document.
- `accept` / `reject`: the assigned agent (admins may act on their behalf); rejection clears the assignment.
- Basic info + applicants/inventors are editable only while `Draft` (`can_edit_basic_info`).
- Draft generation requires `Under Review` and a completed questionnaire; document generation requires `Under Review` or `Draft Generated` and the assigned agent/admin.
- Statuses beyond `Draft Generated` (filing, examination, grant) are display/import states today; no endpoint moves an application into them yet.

## 6. AI drafting

All drafting logic lives in `app/services/drafting.py`:

- `AI_PROVIDER=stub` (default) builds a deterministic placeholder from the questionnaire and appends `DRAFT_WARNING`.
- `AI_PROVIDER=gemini` plus `GEMINI_API_KEY` calls the Gemini REST API (`GEMINI_MODEL`, default `gemini-2.0-flash`) through `httpx`; the warning is re-appended if the model omits it. Any provider failure becomes a `502`.
- `POST /api/patents/{id}/draft/generate` accepts `section_types` (default: all five) and stores one `drafts` document per section with an incremented `version_number`, plus `ai_provider`, `ai_model`, and usage fields.

## 7. Documents and files

- **Documents**: `POST .../documents/generate` runs a generation job synchronously. `app/services/documents.py` renders DOCX with `docxtpl` when an active template exists for the document type, otherwise with the built-in `python-docx` layout. PDF conversion shells out to headless LibreOffice (installed in the Docker image; absent locally → job fails with a clear error). The blob is uploaded to Storage, `documents` / `document_versions` / `document_jobs` rows are written, and the patent moves to `Draft Generated`.
- **Downloads**: files and documents are streamed through the API with `Content-Disposition: attachment`; there are no signed URLs to expire.
- **Files**: `POST .../files` (multipart) validates non-empty content, size cap, and blocked extensions, then stores `patents/{pid}/files/{uuid}{ext}` + a `files` doc. Delete removes blob + doc (uploader, `FILES_DELETE`, or admin).
- **Templates**: `POST /api/templates` (admin, multipart `.docx`) stores `templates/{type}/v{n}.docx`, reports unknown/unused Jinja placeholders in the upload response, and deactivates siblings of the same `document_type` when activated.

## 8. Frontend architecture

- Entry `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` (`QueryClientProvider` + `StrictMode`) → `src/App.tsx` (`BrowserRouter` + `AuthProvider` + role routes).
- `ROLE_HOME` maps the first matching role to its dashboard; `ProtectedRoute` handles gating and pending accounts.
- Data flow: pages → `apiFetch`/`apiUpload`/`apiDownload` → React Query (where used) → `StatusBadge` / `DashboardShell` / feature panels.
- Entity IDs are Firestore strings throughout; only the RBAC catalog keeps numeric role/permission IDs.
- 14 pages (4 dashboards + workflow + draft workspace + admin patent list/detail + calendar + reports + auth pages) and shared components (`DashboardShell`, `ProtectedRoute`, `LoadingState`, `EmptyState`, `StatusBadge`, panels).

## 9. Cross-cutting concerns

- **Config**: `app/core/config.py` (`pydantic-settings`, `.env`, `extra='ignore'`) — Firebase, app, upload, and AI settings only.
- **Observability**: generic 500 handler, request logging via uvicorn/gunicorn access logs, `/health` Firebase probe. There is no structured logging/metrics pipeline yet.
- **Scaling**: single-instance assumption — document generation runs in-process and spawns LibreOffice. See ADR-003.
- **Verification**: `backend/tests/` is an offline suite (no Firebase credentials). Live Auth/Firestore/Storage behaviour is covered by the manual checklist in `backend/README.md` §7.

## 10. Decision records

The reasoning behind the significant choices above is recorded in [`decisions/`](./decisions/):

- [ADR-001](./decisions/ADR-001-firebase-active-runtime.md) — Firebase-native backend as the active runtime (superseded)
- [ADR-002](./decisions/ADR-002-role-codes-array.md) — Roles as a `role_codes` array on the user document
- [ADR-003](./decisions/ADR-003-single-instance.md) — Single backend instance
- [ADR-004](./decisions/ADR-004-stub-first-ai.md) — Stub-first AI drafting with optional Gemini
- [ADR-005](./decisions/ADR-005-firestore-only-runtime.md) — Firestore-only runtime; legacy SQL stack removed
