## Product

**Is generated patent text legal advice?**
No. Every draft — stub or Gemini — is a drafting aid with an explicit
not-legal-advice warning. A qualified patent professional must review anything
before filing.

**Who is this for?**
Innovators (disclose inventions), patent agents (review and draft), admins
(approve users, assign agents, manage templates), and super admins (roles,
permissions, reports). See README §3.

**Which backend does it use?**
Firebase only: Authentication for identity, Cloud Firestore for application
data, Cloud Storage for blobs. The old Postgres/SQLAlchemy stack was removed
in ADR-005; there is no second system of record.

**Can I run it without Firebase?**
The backend boots without credentials, and the frontend builds, but nothing
beyond the login screen works: `/health` returns `503 degraded` and
authenticated calls fail. Use the Firebase Emulator Suite if you need an
offline-ish setup.

## Setup

**Where do the frontend Firebase values come from?**
Firebase console → Project settings → Your apps → Web app → SDK setup and
configuration. Put all six `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values in `frontend/.env`. They
are public identifiers, not secrets.

**Why do I get `403 awaiting approval`?**
New accounts are pending until an Admin approves them. The
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` address becomes Super Admin on first sign-in and can
then approve others.

**Why does `auth/unauthorized-domain` appear after deploying?**
Add the production frontend domain under Firebase Authentication →
Authorized domains. `localhost` is pre-registered; other hosts are not.

**Port 8000 is already in use on my machine.**
Run the backend on another port (e.g. `8001`) and point `VITE_API_URL` at it,
or remap Compose ports. See
[`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#ports-already-in-use).

**PDF generation fails locally.**
DOCX→PDF shells out to headless LibreOffice. It is installed in the Docker
image; on a workstation install LibreOffice or use the image. DOCX generation
works without it.

## Contributing

**Where do I start?**
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (root) + `AGENTS.md` (root, agent-oriented). Pick a
`good first issue`, follow the commit-discipline rules (atomic commits, one
type per commit), and fill the PR template.

**Do I need Firebase credentials to run the tests?**
No. `backend/tests/` forces empty Firebase configuration and asserts boot,
the mounted frontend contract, and pure-Python services. Live Firebase and
LibreOffice behaviour is a manual checklist (`backend/README.md` §7).

**Why is there no database container in Compose?**
Firestore is managed and external. Compose builds only the backend and
frontend images.

**How should I cite this project?**
See `CITATION.cff` at the repo root (GitHub renders a *Cite this repository*
button from it).

**What license is this?**
Apache-2.0 — see `LICENSE`. Contributions are accepted under the same license.
